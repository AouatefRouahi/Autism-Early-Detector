    "1. **Definition**\n",
    "> **Autism Spectrum Disorder** (ASD) is a developmental disorder of variable severity that is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and by restricted or repetitive patterns of thought and behaviour [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistics**  [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/): \n",
    "> * 1 / 44 children has been identified with ASD\n",
    "> * Prevalence among boys = 4 x Prevalence among girls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Early Detection** [ABSKids](https://abkids.org/):\n",
    "> * Better understanding of the disorder\n",
    "> * ASD effects can be reduced at an early age\n",
    "> * Better therapeutic results\n",

    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we propose an artificial early detector of Autism Spectrum Disorder in children between 3 and 6 years old that addresses both visual and linguistic symptoms. The detector is a combined model based on 2 trained components: \n",
    "* **Image-based Component**: is based on the facial **photos** of children; \n",
    "* **Text-based Component**: is based on childrenâ€™s **speeches**\n",
