    ">To get the **textual** data that contains the children's speech, we had recourse to the [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/), that is a multilingual **corpus** established in 2002 to foster fundamental research in the study of human and animal communication. We scraped speech of children **with** and **without Autism Spectrum Disaster (ASD)**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We have ensured that the children that do not present the ASD **do not present other linguistic disorders**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The textual data on the TalkBank is organised by **topic** (CHILDS, ASDBank, PhonBank, AphasiaBank, ....). Under each topic, there are other classification by language (English, French, Chinese, ...). Once the right repository is found, all the speech data in the TalkBank is transcripted in the **CHAT** format as files with the extension **.cha**. In the header of each cha file, a description of the context is found. We parsed that description to find out if the child presents the ASD or any other disorder. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The scraping of the children's speech is made as follows:\n",
    ">> **Step 1)** **Scrape** the **URL**s of the diffrent **repostories** where cha files are saved using the criterium: **ASD or NO-ASD**.   \n",
    "**Step 2)** **Scrape** the **URL**s of the **cha files** that contain the children speech.      \n",
    "**Step 3)** **Scrape and Parse** the **cha files content** using a **yaml** file that specifies the elements to be scraped. After parsing the content of the cha file, only the relevant elements are saved into a **csv** file. The **name, age, sex** and the **target** value are scraped from the header of the cha file. The **target** value is induced as **0** for the children without ASD and **1** for those with the ASD. The **speech** is scraped from the corpus of the cha file.\n",

In addition, some linguistic habits such as babbling are very frequent among children before **3** years and they are considered as positive signs of normal development.
